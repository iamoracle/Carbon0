# Carbon0 - Simplifying Carbon Offsetting

**_Built with love with Toucan Protocol_**

## Introduction

Carbon0 is a mobile app that aims to simplify carbon offsetting. Using the Toucan protocol, we provide a user-friendly platform enabling carbon market transparency. Our goal is to increase the adoption of Toucan Protocol among the over 6 billion mobile app users.

## Problems & Solutions

We understand that navigating the current carbon market can be difficult and opaque. That's why we have created a solution that is accessible and easy to navigate. Our decision to create a mobile app was based on research that showed mobile apps have over four times more conversation rates than users, and most time spent on mobile phones is within apps.

## Features

At the hackathon, we successfully implemented several features to our app using Toucan Protocol, React Native, TypeScript, Graph Protocol, and  WalletConnect. These features will allow users to:

1. Auto-redeem carbon credit
2. Retire carbon credit
3. Mint NFT
4. Search functionality
5. Track carbon credits.

## Future Plan

To stay relevant in the future, we understand that we must continue to implement new features, such as:

1. Trading BCT, NCT & TCO2
2. Off-ramp & On-ramp and improve user experience.

We will release our alpha version on the App Store and Google Play Store.

## Challenges and Lessons During the Hackathon

During the hackathon, we faced several challenges, which we successfully tackled and learned from. Our first challenge was integrating the WalletConnect V2 SDK with our React Native App. We overcame this obstacle by researching and studying how to incorporate the wallet into our app. Our persistence paid off, as we could connect the SDK flawlessly with our app. This challenge provided us with an opportunity to enhance our problem-solving skills.

We faced a second challenge while connecting WalletConnect Web3 Modal with Celo Network. Unfortunately, we couldn't carry out transactions on the Celo Alfajores Testnet due to an issue with the EIP155 standard. However, we explored other options and discovered that the Celo Mainnet was compatible with EIP155. We successfully migrated and executed transactions without any problems. This experience highlighted the significance of testing and ensuring compatibility with our network.

We faced a compatibility issue with Metamask not supporting WalletConnect  V2. Our initial plan was to use Metamask to connect to our wallets, so we had to find a workaround. We researched several wallet connection strategies and discovered that Valora was compatible with Wallet Connect  V2. We made the switch to Valora to continue the developmental process. This challenge showed us the importance of having fallback strategies and reminded us that technology is always changing. We need to be ready to adjust to these changes.

Finally,  we are unable to share the expo demo URL due to Apple Policy restrictions. When the URL is accessed, it always returns error 403. To address this issue, we have provided a sample login credential for the project. You can be confident that this will not affect the project, and the issue will be resolved as soon as the hackathon is finished.
